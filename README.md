### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Roman, Head of Product at Tiugo â€” the company behind TinyMCE, CKEditor, Uploadcare, and ButterCMS. Formerly Head of Product at Tiny (acquired by Tiugo), previously co-founded Setka (acquired by Tiny).

My work focuses on three key areas: driving product-led growth through self-service platforms, developing industry-leading WYSIWYG rich-text editors (TinyMCE and CKEditor, boasting over 30K GitHub stars), and ensuring smooth product operations.
