### Hi there! 👋

I'm Roman, Senior Director of Product at Tiugo — the company behind TinyMCE, CKEditor, Uploadcare, and ButterCMS. Formerly Head of Product at Tiny (acquired by Tiugo), previously co-founded Setka (acquired by Tiny).

My work focuses on three key areas: directing Tiugo's end-to-end generative AI program across its brand portfolio, owning the product roadmap for four portfolio brands, and acting as a hands-on PM staying close to customers, UX, and code by driving discovery, planning, and shipping.

If you want to contact me, just drop a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khudonogov/).
